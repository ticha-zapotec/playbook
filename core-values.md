# Ticha – Core Values

Last updated November 8, 2024

## Respect
> We center Zapotec needs, knowledge, and culture while engaging technology, people, and historical materials with care. 

## Responsiveness
> We seek, solicit, and iterate on feedback and direction from Zapotec individuals and communities. The “Zapotec agenda” (i.e. community priorities) shapes our initiatives.  

## Restoration
> Zapotec languages are living language today that are a source of identity and joy to ***buny dizhsa*** ‘Zapotec people’ in Oaxaca and diaspora. We identify and digitally repatriate Zapotec language resources and knowledge that are currently inaccessible to Zapotec people.

## Right relationship
> We collaborate across disciplines, institutions, and borders and recognize the cultural, historical, and economic differences between our team members and our community partners. We seek to understand and support each other in right relationship.

## Reciprocity
> We situate our work on Ticha within the Zapotec framework of ***galguez*** ‘reciprocity’ understanding that we have received gifts of expertise, labor, and time and seek to in turn offer time, labor, and resources to Zapotec communities. For this reason, we also ensure Ticha resources are available publicly at no cost.
