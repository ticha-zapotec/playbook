# Ticha – Design Principles

Last updated November 8, 2024

## Context 

### What are they?
> Design principles are value statements that guide our decisions about the things we create.

### Why use them? 
> They help us make realistic, kind, and sustainable decisions when designing features for Ticha. They clearly state what is most important to us, empowering us to say “yes” to things that align with our principles and “no” to things that don’t.

### How do they work?
> For every feature request, new idea, or proposed solution to a problem, we ask ourselves if it meets each design principle. If each principle is satisfied, we can choose to move forward with confidence! If not, we can either adjust the proposal to ensure all principles are met, or set the idea aside. 

## Our Design Principles

### We keep it simple.
> We prioritize simple, common, open source, and sustainable tools. We choose legible and learnable solutions. We start every design conversation with a consideration of the technical context in Zapotec communities in Mexico, including limited or unstable internet connectivity, devices with less computing power, and other infrastructural and economic differences. Our workflows are simple and transparent, and we do not let our tools complicate them unless it is absolutely necessary.

### We build from a strong foundation.
> The primary materials of Ticha–digitized documents, metadata, transcriptions, and contextual content–are our foundation. Features that interrogate these materials can only move forward if the materials themselves are rock solid. Access and discovery starts with well-organized, maintained, and persistent storage.

### If it is worth doing, it is worth doing well.
> We dream big, but we address real and explicit needs while adhering to best practices. We launch new features after rigorous testing and quality control. We understand that features have life cycles within a defined scope, timeline, and success criteria. Recognizing that work may be useful to the communities in various stages of revision, we resist the perfectionism that keeps resources from people. In other words, we understand that  “done” may look different to different users.  We launch materials based on their usefulness to our users.  But we are rigorous about our quality control and do not launch features that are not sustainable within the Ticha architecture. If it’s not tangibly achievable within the resources available, we either shelve the idea or rethink it.

### Our solutions are people-centered.
> We prioritize our key user groups–members of Zapotec communities, scholars of related disciplines, students, language activists, and knowledge workers. Community needs and interests inform our technical infrastructure. We recognize that Ticha primary materials are a crucial part of related meetings, events, and classes, and design with that in mind. Collaboration and partnership are crucial to knowledge creation, so we develop features that facilitate collaboration and do not limit it. Finally, we ground our solutions in the users’ material realities, including but not limited to their internet access, technical capacity, and comfort with digital tools.

### We recognize the work.
> Ticha is built on the time, labor, and expertise of many people, including core team members, students, administrators, researchers, and community members. This array of work can be complex, domain-specific, and difficult to understand, both within and outside of our interdisciplinary team. We recognize the contributions of everyone involved and understand that sharing our work is central to the work itself. We do this by highlighting milestones, citing publications, amplifying community projects, and creating public documentation to help us see and be seen in the work.
